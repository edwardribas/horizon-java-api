### My first Java Spring-boot API

Initial empty template by https://start.spring.io/. \
Application made using Maven as build system.

Some of the skills I've used/learned:
- Reactive programming with MongoDB
- Implementing Swagger
- Common folder structure/conventions with Java Spring-boot
- Download new dependencies with Maven
- ~~Always check if the dependencies are compatible and not creating another application.properties~~
